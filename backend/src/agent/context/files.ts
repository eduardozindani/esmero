/*

here we gather all necessary files that are relevant for user as context and return string, beautifully strucutred....

a. current section focused.

b. current file focused.

c. relevant folders, then retrieve relevant files for each... Done in parallel.

Therefore, we will have structured text, that looks like this:

<Current section focused>
... or null
</Current section focused>

<Current page focused>
Current page
</Current section focused>

<relevant files>
<file_x or null>
folder name: ... or null
file name: ...
file text: ...
</file_x or null>
</relevant files>
